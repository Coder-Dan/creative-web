# About this Web site

## Preface

I had change of heart. I like to keep my project to myself but then no one will ever see the work I can do. So this is will be my first project that I'll be putting out in the open. So you can fork it, recommend edits or use it as a basis for your own project - I'll be learning from developing and hopefully this action leads to an improved independant and continuous development that is outside of work and univeristity.

## Project Description

### How have I build it?

* With sheer tenacity :). No but really, I did have a lot of drive when I start. I just keep writing and writing, looking up stuff on the internet and just reading and applying what I've seen. I do actually have some design documents on paper for the layout of the website.

* Building in **In Stages**:
    * Over the development process, I've been reading new resources and applying my code here to test new development and understand web code examples.
    * Periodically, I make new updates to this website to learn some more HTML and CSS tricks to apply. But my goal was to understand how program a good website design is programmed, and understand how to manipulated it to a simple designs of my own.
    * At the moment I'm yet to include some JavaScript and I'm leaving web services to last - just to focus on design and structuring HTML pages.

### What is this website?

* This website is designed to be as personal website for professional profile, it will be leaning more for programmers and developers, **as of May 2017, and can be subject to change**.

## Documentation

Here I'll write stuff about topic I've looked to understand and implement. Most of the stuff I write here, means that I've also implemented in this code.
